💹 Crypto API Data Fetcher

This project demonstrates how to interact with cryptocurrency APIs using Python to retrieve and analyze real-time data such as coin prices, market caps, and trading volumes. Built as a Jupyter Notebook, it’s perfect for learning API integration, JSON handling, and financial data analysis.

🚀 Features

Fetches real-time cryptocurrency data using public APIs

Parses and structures JSON responses

Displays live prices, market trends, and volume data

Stores results in CSV format for further analysis

Simple and modular code for easy customization

🧠 Technologies Used

Python 3

Requests

JSON

Pandas

Jupyter Notebook

🧩 How It Works

Connects to a cryptocurrency API (e.g., CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap).

Retrieves JSON data containing coin names, prices, market caps, etc.

Cleans and structures the data using pandas.

Exports the results to a CSV file for future analysis.


💡 Future Enhancements

Add data visualization using Matplotlib or Plotly

Automate data fetching at intervals (real-time dashboard)

Integrate sentiment analysis using Twitter API

Build a REST API wrapper for crypto analysis
